# DriverCouponProject

This was a group project done with students in my class. We worked together to find this dataset, and then cleaned and analyzed it. Our goal was to determine if a driver would accept a coupon they were given based on varibles know about the individual. We created visuals to represent the data, and used a K Nearest Neigbors model, reaching a 66% accuracy.
